### **Rock Paper Scissor Game using Python**

This is a simple game of Rock, Paper, Scissors implemented in Python. The user is prompted to enter their name and asked if they want to play the game. The game is played for a total of 5 rounds, and the user can choose between rock (r), paper (p), and scissors (s) for each round. The computer randomly selects its choice, and the winner of each round is determined based on the traditional rules of the game. The score is kept track of for both the user and the computer, and at the end of the game, the winner is declared based on who has the higher score. The program also prints out messages indicating the outcome of each round, and how many rounds are left.

The loop in the given code is a while loop that runs until the number of chances for the game is exhausted. Within the loop, the program takes input from the user for Rock, Paper, or Scissors and generates a random selection for the computer. It then checks the input against the computer's choice and assigns points to the winner. At the end of each iteration of the loop, the program checks if the game is tied, if the computer or user won, and prints the current score. Finally, the loop updates the number of chances left and prints a message to indicate the number of remaining chances.
